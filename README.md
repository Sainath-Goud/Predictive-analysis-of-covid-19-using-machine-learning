An extensive application of machine learning algorithms to predict COVID-19 infection, demonstrating the potential of data science in healthcare.


# COVID-19 Infection Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project applies several machine learning algorithms to predict COVID-19 infection. The models used include Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Gradient Boost Classifier, and Naive Bayesian. A thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to prepare the data for modeling.

## Key Findings
- Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and KNN models demonstrated robust predictive capabilities, with accuracy scores exceeding 96%.
- Random Forest and Gradient Boost Classifier models showcased commendable performance, with scores surpassing 87%.
- Naive Bayesian model indicated room for improvement, with an accuracy score of 77.37%.

## Conclusion
The study effectively employed a multitude of machine learning models to forecast COVID-19 infection, with Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, and KNN yielding the highest predictive accuracy. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning in augmenting our predictive capabilities and responsiveness towards infectious diseases like COVID-19. Future research could focus on optimizing these models or extending their application to other infectious diseases.
